# VDU App: Veteran Discharge Upgrade Locator

Modular Python tool designed to locate and parse discharge upgrade files across .MIL and VA portals.

> **Note:** This tool is designed to help veterans reduce their need to constantly stalk the .MIL reading rooms. Also designed with a focus on enabling visibility for veterans and VSOs. Built as part of a portfolio as I develop skills across Cyber Security domains.

## Features
- Static URL Parsing for known upgrade portals.
- Modular file locator with extensible architecture.
- Ethical design: no scraping, impersonation or unauthorized access. 

> **Note:** All features are designed compliance and ethical rigor in mind. Future phases include PDF delivery and dashboard integration. 

## Planned Phases
1. Single case query handling.
2. PDF download and metadata validation.
3. Email Alerting for individual veterans and VSO case managers. 
4. Web dashboard for multiple file status tracking for VSO case managers. 

**Note:** Each phase is modular and independently deployable. Designed to support phased Github commits.
